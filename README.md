## **Customer Churn Prediction: A Data Science Approach**

**Project Type:** Machine Learning | Classification  
**Tools Used:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost  
**Dataset:** Telco Customer Churn (Kaggle)

### **Objective**

Customer churn directly impacts a company's revenue and growth. This project builds a **predictive model** to identify high-risk customers, enabling proactive retention strategies.

### **Key Steps**

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identified key trends in customer behavior and churn rates.
- **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering**: Handled missing values, transformed categorical variables, and engineered features for better model performance.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Compared Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, and XGBoost, optimizing for recall and AUC-ROC.

### **Results**

- **Best Model:** Logistic Regression (Highest explainability, strong performance)
- **Key Insights:** Customers with **fiber optic internet** and **electronic check payments** had higher churn rates.
- **Business Impact:** Predicting churn allows companies to **proactively retain customers**, reducing revenue loss.
